# KineoGuard
Muscular injury is a common risk in daily life, whether from
exercise or simply moving around as part of a daily routine.
Many people, specifically those who engage in exercise, would
prefer to take steps to prevent this while others - even with
preventative measures - may still need to eventually see a
Physiotherapist, Kinisthesiologist or Professional Trainer (Health
Professional) for rehabilitation.

Our vision is to improve access for people to stretches and
massages and provide a platform for easy interaction between
Health Professionals and their clients. To address this issue we
have designed the application, KineoGuard, which provides a
repository of stretches, massages and other muscle exercises
(Movement Exercises), validated by Health Professionals. It
additionally provides the ability for Health Professionals to
interact with clients and provide them with personalised
Movement Exercise Routines which include video and textual
demonstrations to improve the rehabilitation experience.

The areas of focus for KineoGuard were informed by the
interviews conducted with potential users during the first iteration
of the design. Results from said interviews allowed us to reduce
the scope and improve the vision for KineoGuard to properly
address the issues that potential users have encountered when
looking for Movement Exercises. Through user evaluations with
target user participants, fellow Human Computer Interaction
Students and Health Professionals we have made appropriate
additions to our current iteration of the design.
